Marriage Proposal
=================

A letter I wrote as a prelude to my proposal to [Michelle](https://www.facebook.com/MiaShauri). I managed to disappear to wait for her at [Vizcaya](http://vizcaya.org/) and arranged for this letter to be delivered to her. She said yes!

> Dear Michelle,
>
> As of yesterday, we've been together for 8 years. Not many would argue that it isn't a long time to be in love. Some marriages don't last this long. The thing is that, to be very honest, I feel like I've loved you for far longer than that.
>
> Ever since the first time I heard The Beatles' play "Michelle", I've been in love with the idea of a woman. This idea didn't come about from the lyrics, it was more like a notion. It was a moment of purity where what would soon become one of my favorite pieces of art tapped into something deeply personal and emotional. I fantasized about my idea: an elegant but playful, aloof but approachable, smooth but endeeringly awkward woman. A woman of such grace and intelligence that to be in her presence is to have all of my senses engaged in perfect symmetry. Even when I can't consciously understand her, being together seems to unveil a profound truth that makes sense of all the Cosmos. I longed to be with that woman and envelop her in my affection. I longed for that euphoria that two people in harmony can share.
>
> When you finally caught my eye it was because my subconscious, amazingly and against all odds, recognized that woman. The details, those things that ideas and fantasies never fill in for you, have delighted and surprised me over the years. But now I finally understand why I love you: when I'm with you it feels like the truth. It feels like all the stars in the Universe are shining their light on us. It feels like a choir of all the hosts of angels in Heaven sing a symphony for us. All this only for us. And there's a foxy angel with ivory skin and long, dark, flowing hair that's quietly singing love songs for me. As a human I'm flawed, but I fly up to my zenith by you.

> I'd like to celebrate this momentous anniversary with you by giving you a surprise. Though before you can receive it you must first meet me. To meet me, you'll have to find me. To find me, you have to solve a riddle:
>
> > In the green lavish fortress I do wait.
> > There is such heat, my love, please don't be late!
> > With my new start I have forsaken wine.
> > I ask Dionysus: what shall we dine?
> >
> > Surprise I've got and under light it sings!
> > Please you with elfen fairness, wear this thing!
> > Adventure's close will fill my heart with cheer.
> > Shall we not meet outside the house of Deer?
>
> When you figure out where to go, there's something for you in front desk that will help you get there.
>
> Yours faithfully in love,
