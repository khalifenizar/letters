So Long, Nobox!
===============

A farewell to the [Nobox](https://twitter.com/Nobox) team.


Monday, August 11th, 2014

Dear Nobox,

Here's one final long-winded email full of warm feels for you to enjoy.

**tl;dr** - So long and thanks for all the fish. Remember to be nice. Keep in touch!

First of all I'd like to thank you! I was touched by your kind words of encouragement on my farewell card and I really loved that amazingly clever picture you so nicely had printed and framed for me. I feel truly honored that so many of you chose to wear the image as your Facebook avatar! My words are completely inadequate to articulate how fantastic a sendoff you have given me. Those of you that stuck around after work on my last day made sure that I had a great time! To everyone responsible for these things I wish to express my most heartfelt gratitude.

Before I start doing shoutouts (of which there are many), I'd like to leave you with a message. Some of you may remember that another former employee left you with a quote from a film about time travel:

> Be excellent to each other.

But I'll get back to that in a moment, because I have some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is that many of you are performing drastically below your potential. The good news is that I know you can be better. Now, I'm not referring to Photoshopping 10% faster, writing copy that's 10% sexier, extracting 10% more revenue from clients, targeting media 10% more accurately, engaging 10% more people on Twitter, stocking the fridge with 10% yummier snacks, planning company finances 10% more effectively or improving app load times by 10% (although those improvements wouldn't hurt either). I'm talking about our more human qualities. Humans are weak. We are rancorous. We are violent. We make errors more frequently than we care to admit. But we are also conscious. We are also gentle, graceful and compassionate. We are kind and in turn respond to kindness.

We may often take for granted something as obvious as that small quote from one of the few good Keanu Reeves movies (no thanks to him) but I'd like you to make an effort to remember. It's simplicity is deceptive: being "excellent" could mean different things to different people. I think it's very easy for us to convince ourselves that we know what it means without really giving it too much thought. Here's the meaning I give it and, consequently, what I strive to do: once in a while respond with affection when you might have been apathetic. Return empathy when you are met with rudeness. When someone displeases you, search for their frustration and not their fault. Reflect on moments of tension and don't be afraid to show remorse. In short, be (even just slightly) nicer both inside the office and without. You guys are already good, but you each could be beacons of shining light. Why settle?

Now for my favorite thing about Nobox: the people.

- **[Antonio](https://twitter.com/antoniwan) & [Jorge](https://twitter.com/prodigioso)**: In my time of greatest need you not only granted me fair pay for fair work but, much more precious than that, you offered me friendship. Together in the last 3.5 years we built a remarkable thing: an office culture of tongue-in-cheek, jest, camaraderie and trust. In our office people aren't just colleagues but they are also friends. That still persists to this day and, as far as I'm concerned, it started with four dudes in an Hato Rey office.
- **[Chris](https://twitter.com/chrislately)**: I can't imagine how any other partnership could execute good cop / bad cop better than we two. If everyone could see you as I do, they would see a brilliant, comical, kind, classy, determined and capable lady. I can't help but be impressed by the way you can be so blunt and tolerate no nonsense while still remaining courteous. I'm lucky to have been partnered for so long with such an exceptional person and even more fortunate still to count you among my friends.
- **The Development Team**: To Antonio, [Kiko](https://twitter.com/kikobertuu), [Waldemar](https://twitter.com/waldemar_fm), [Champion](https://twitter.com/torres_jonathan) and those who have already left - we were and always will be much more than a team. We are brothers in arms, bringers of order to a chaos of ones and zeroes. Our bond can't be erased by time or distance. Though I am leaving to fight on another battlefield, we continue the fight together.
- **[Charito](http://instagram.com/charosepu) & [Rosalyn](http://instagram.com/gylpimarie)**: You two are always up for an adventure! Be it happy hour, karaoke, video games, movies, etc., you guys are there! I gladly overlook your weakness for furry four-legged creatures, the occasional streak of hate (Rosa) and some bad jokes (Charo) because you are delightful to be around and have uncommonly large hearts.
- **[Cecilia](https://twitter.com/Cecix)**: Before you moved to Texas, you and your wife (please forward that zinger) were a big part of my family. You are my Mother Hen: a generous, thoughtful, caring and true friend. You also take care of yours and your team's shit. And your Google Doc organization skills are the stuff of legend.
- **[Carlos](https://twitter.com/carlosnobox) & [Jayson](https://twitter.com/jfittipaldi)**: You are the kind of company owners that you can shoot the shit with, in spite of not having known you beforehand. In all my conversations with both of you, I was allowed the space to be unapologetically honest and I really dig that. Please continue to allow that honesty and empower people like Colin to make Nobox better!
- **Everyone else**: Please forgive me if I neglect to single you out. I assure you that my heart has not forgotten any small kindness that has been done for me over the years. Somewhere in there we shared at least one laugh and it was probably a really good one.

As I go, I'd like to invite each and every one of you to keep the lines of communication with me open! I'll do the same to the best of my ability! Here are some channels that I pay attention to:

- **email**: khalifenizar@gmail.com
- **mobile**: `+1 999-999-9999`
- **twitter**: https://twitter.com/khalifenizar

Finally, I'd like to leave you with a quote of my own:

> And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.

That one is by The Beatles, for you crazy kids out there that might not have known.

Yours until my body ceases to grow hair (because I'd have long been dead),

-Nizar
