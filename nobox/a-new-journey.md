A New Journey
=============

Announcing my departure from Nobox.


>Hey Nobox!
>
>I'm writing you all to let you know that I've resigned from Nobox. My work with Nobox will continue until the end of July, after which, to be quite honest, my future is still uncertain. This decision has been a complicated and bittersweet one. On one hand I've experienced a lot of frustration in my role developing things both for clients and for us. On the other hand, I've also been delighted time and time again by the talent, charm and poise of our team (both past and present). While my reasons for leaving are my own, I invite anyone to have a chat with me about any of this over our beverages of choice!

>It may seem a bit odd for me to send this email so far in advance of my departure. For starters, I wanted for as many people as possible to learn this from me rather than through the grapevine (though I'm certain some of you have already heard that way). Secondly, I didn't want this news to catch anyone by surprise (as has often happened to me), in the sense that I don't want to leave so suddenly that it seems like I just disappeared. Rather, I would like to take advantage of the final weeks in which we see each other every day to increase our comradery. I've been very fortunate to get to know many of you very well and I'd like to share even more time with those individuals. I'd also like get to know those that I don't know very well. So let's have lunches and do after work activities (such as drinks or whatever)! Let's do things together!

>After all if you ask me, the best things we do are those we do together.
